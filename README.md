# Machine Learning Through Self-Driving Cars Expercises
This repository stores code for the course: Machine Learning Through Self-Driving Cars

## Sections
- Python: code used for lectures (it's recommended to start from scratch)
- Computer Vision: using the simulator Webots, we will make a car follow the road line
- Machine Learning (Road Sign Classification): we will use Machine Learning to classify road signs (i.e. the model will be able to tell if the image contains a stop sign, speed limit sign, ...)
- Collision Avoidance: Using a Lidar we will make make our car drive without crashing
- Deep Learning (Behavioural Clonning): Using the power of Deep Neural Netowrks we will make the car drive like ourselves!

## Pre-requisites
- Install Python
- Install Visual Studio Code
