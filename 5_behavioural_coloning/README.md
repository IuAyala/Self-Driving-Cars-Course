# Behavioural Cloning Section
This section we will use the power of Deep Learning to have the car drive like a human driver.

# TODO:
- Open Webots by double clicking the file "Self-Driving-Cars/words/city.wbt"
- Run the code the file "1_create_dataset.py", drive around, while doing it the code will generate the dataset that we will use to train
- Run the individual cells of "2_dataset_insights.ipynb" to get interesting ingishts about the dataset that you have generated
- Run "3_train.py", this will use the dataset that we just generated to create a model that will drive like us (while generating the dataset, "1_create_dataset.py")
- Run "4_run_model.py" to see it drive
    - Remember: you can use the arrow keys of your keyboard (or an Xbox controller) to correct the path of the vehicle if you thinig that it will crash
- Run the individual cells of "5_explain.py" to better understand why the model drives as it does
